random password generation
This program first imports two libraries: random and string. random is used to generate random numbers and characters, while string contains a string of characters that can be used in a password.

The program then defines the generate_password function, which generates a random password of the given length. The function first sets the list of valid characters, which includes letters of the alphabet, digits, and certain special characters. It then generates a random password by choosing characters from the list of valid characters at random.

The last two lines of the program ask the user for the password length and print the generated password to the screen.
